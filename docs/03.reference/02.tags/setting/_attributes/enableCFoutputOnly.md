Yes, No or Reset.

When set to Yes, cfsetting blocks output of HTML that resides outside cfoutput tags.

When used multiple times, this setting is cumulative, so enabling it twice, requires to it to be turned off twice.

Use `reset`, to reset that count and re-enable output of html outside cfoutput tags.
