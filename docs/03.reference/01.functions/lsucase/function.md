---

Converts the alphabetic characters in a specified string to uppercase, respecting locale-specific casing rules. 

This is particularly important for languages where the standard/ typical (i.e. western) case conversion rules do not apply, ensuring accurate and culturally correct text processing. 

The function defaults to the current page's locale if no locale is specified.
