Creates a JavaScript expression that assigns the value of a variable to a JavaScript variable.

This function can convert strings, numbers, arrays, structures, and queries to JavaScript syntax that defines equivalent variables and values.

This function always forces keys to lowercase, in both ACF and Lucee, as such it's recommended to use [[function-serializejson]] instead.
