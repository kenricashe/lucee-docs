Controls whether the conversation history should be condensed before serialization.

When set to true, the function will intelligently summarize older parts of the conversation while preserving essential context.

This reduces the overall token count and storage requirements while maintaining the important elements of the conversation history.
Default is false, which preserves the complete conversation history.
